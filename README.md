# Result Management System (In Development)

A modern web-based **Result Management System** built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **PHP**. This system is designed to help schools or institutions manage student and teacher records, enter academic results, and view performance analytics efficiently through a responsive and intuitive interface.

> **Note:** This project is currently under active development and is hosted in a private repository. It will be made public once it reaches a significant milestone.

## Features

- **Admin Dashboard** with responsive layout and dark mode
- **Student Management**  
  - Add, edit, delete, search, filter, and export student data
- **Teacher Management**  
  - Manage teacher information and roles
- **Result Entry & Processing** *(Coming Soon)*
- **Performance Analytics** *(Coming Soon)*  
  - Gender and class-based visualizations (charts, graphs)
- **Recent Activities Log**
- **Secure Authentication System** *(Planned)*
- **Responsive Design** (mobile-friendly using Tailwind CSS)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js & npm  
- PHP & MySQL  
- A local server (e.g., XAMPP, MAMP, Laravel server)

### Frontend Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/result-management-system.git
cd result-management-system/frontend
npm install
npm start
```

### Backend Setup

- Place your PHP API in your local server directory (e.g., `htdocs`)
- Configure your `config.php` with the correct database credentials
- Use Postman or connect your frontend to test API endpoints

### Database

- Create a MySQL database (e.g., `result_system`)
- Add tables for:
  - `students`
  - `teachers`
  - `results`
  - `users` (for authentication)
- SQL schema will be added soon

## Development Status

- [x] Admin layout & dark mode
- [x] Student & teacher modules (UI & basic logic)
- [ ] Result management backend
- [ ] Charts and analytics
- [ ] Authentication system
- [ ] Notifications & logs
- [ ] Testing & validation

## Screenshots

*Coming soon as the UI evolves*

## Roadmap

- Add subject-wise result tracking
- Improve role-based access control (admin, teacher, student)
- Create bulk import/export system
- Integrate JWT or session-based login system
- Add unit/integration tests
